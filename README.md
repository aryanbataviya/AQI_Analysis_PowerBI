# AQI Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an **Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis Dashboard** built using **Microsoft Power BI**.
The dashboard provides interactive insights into Delhi’s air quality trends for the year **2025**, helping users understand pollution levels, pollutant distribution, and regional comparisons.

The objective of this project is to transform raw AQI data into meaningful visual insights for better environmental monitoring and decision-making.
